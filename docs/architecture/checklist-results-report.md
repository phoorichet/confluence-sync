## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Items:**
1. **SQLite Migration Path** - JSON manifest may need optimization for 1000+ pages
   - *Mitigation:* Schema designed for easy SQLite migration when needed
2. **Rate Limiting at Scale** - 5000 req/hour may limit large space operations
   - *Mitigation:* Circuit breaker and exponential backoff implemented
3. **Format Conversion Fidelity** - Complex Confluence macros not fully supported in MVP
   - *Mitigation:* Clear MVP scope, post-MVP roadmap includes full macro support

## Recommendations

**Must-Fix:** None - architecture is ready for development

**Should-Consider:**
- Add structured logging library (winston/pino) for production debugging
- Consider binary distribution via pkg for non-npm users
- Add performance benchmarks for large-scale operations

**Nice-to-Have:**
- GraphQL consideration for future Confluence API v3
- Plugin architecture detailed specification for community extensions

## AI Implementation Readiness

**Strengths for AI Implementation:**
- Components sized appropriately for single AI agent sessions
- Clear interfaces and single responsibilities
- Explicit coding standards prevent common AI mistakes
- Test requirements guide AI-generated tests
- Security rules embedded to prevent credential leaks

**Areas of Excellence:**
- File structure clearly defined with ASCII diagram
- Naming conventions explicitly stated
- Error codes standardized (CS-XXX format)
- Critical rules section prevents common pitfalls

## Final Assessment

✅ **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**

The architecture is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for implementation. The design is particularly well-suited for AI agent development with clear boundaries, explicit standards, and comprehensive guidance. All PRD requirements are addressed with appropriate technical solutions.
