### Data Models

**SearchResult Model:**
```typescript
interface SearchResult {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  type: 'page' | 'blogpost';
  spaceKey: string;
  spaceName: string;
  lastModified: Date;
  author: string;
  contentSnippet: string; // First 100 chars of content
  url: string; // Web URL to page
  score?: number; // Relevance score from search
}
```

**SavedFilter Model:**
```typescript
interface SavedFilter {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  query?: string; // Text search query
  cql?: string; // Raw CQL query
  filters: {
    author?: string;
    modifiedAfter?: string; // ISO 8601 date
    label?: string[];
    space?: string[];
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  lastUsed?: Date;
}
```
[Source: Designed based on requirements]

### API Specifications

**Search Endpoint:**
```
POST /search/cql
Body: {
  cql: string,
  limit: number,
  start: number,
  expand?: string[]
}
Response: {
  results: Array<SearchResult>,
  start: number,
  limit: number,
  size: number,
  totalSize: number
}
```
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Confluence REST API]

**CQL Examples:**
- Text search: `text ~ "search term"`
- By space: `space = "MYSPACE"`
- By author: `creator = "username"`
- By date: `lastmodified > "2025-01-01"`
- By label: `label = "important"`
- Combined: `space = "DEV" AND label = "api" AND lastmodified > "2025-01-01"`

- `src/commands/search.ts` - Search command implementation
- `src/sync/search-service.ts` - Search business logic
- `src/utils/glob-matcher.ts` - Glob pattern matching utility
- `src/utils/cql-builder.ts` - CQL query builder helper
- `src/storage/filter-manager.ts` - Saved filter management
- `tests/unit/commands/search.test.ts` - Command tests
- `tests/integration/sync/search-service.test.ts` - Service tests
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Libraries and Tools
- **chalk** (5.3.0) - Already available for colored output
- **ora** (8.0.0) - Already available for progress indication
- **zod** (3.22.0) - Already available for filter validation
- **p-limit** (5.0.0) - Already available for concurrent operations
- **minimatch** or **micromatch** - May need to add for glob support (or use Bun's built-in glob)
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### Technical Implementation Notes

**Search Strategy:**
1. Use CQL API for all searches (most flexible)
2. Build CQL from text query and filters
3. Cache search results for 5 minutes to avoid repeated API calls
4. Default limit: 25 results, max: 100 per request

**Glob Pattern Implementation:**
- Use Bun's native glob support if available
- Fallback to minimatch library if needed
- Apply patterns to page titles post-search
- Support negative patterns with ! prefix

**Bulk Operations:**
- Use p-limit with concurrency of 5 for bulk pulls
- Check manifest before pulling to avoid duplicates
- Create progress bar showing pages pulled/total
- Batch updates to manifest after all pulls complete

**Filter Storage:**
- Store in .confluence-sync.json under 'filters' key
- Each filter has unique name as key
- Track usage statistics for smart suggestions
- Validate filter schema with Zod on load

### Coding Standards
- Error codes CS-1000 to CS-1099 for search operations
- Use logger from src/utils/logger.ts (never console.log)
- All async operations must have timeout handling
- Use singleton pattern for FilterManager
- Implement proper error messages with suggestions
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `tests/unit/commands/` for search command
- Test file location: `tests/integration/sync/` for search service
- Use Vitest 1.2.0 with Bun test runner
- Mock Confluence API responses using MSW
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use spyOn() for mocking, not vi.mock()
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

### Specific Test Requirements
- Test CQL query building from various filter combinations
- Test glob pattern matching with edge cases
- Test search result formatting and display
- Test bulk operations with progress tracking
- Test saved filter CRUD operations
- Test pagination handling for large result sets
- Test error handling for invalid CQL queries
- Test confirmation prompts for bulk operations
- Mock search API responses with realistic data

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent understanding of search functionality and proper integration with the existing codebase. The developer successfully implemented all 7 acceptance criteria with comprehensive features including CQL support, glob patterns, bulk operations, and saved filters.

**Key Strengths:**
- Proper use of singleton pattern across SearchService and FilterManager
- Comprehensive error handling with mapped error codes
- Well-structured command with proper validation using Zod schemas
- Good caching strategy with 5-minute TTL for search results
- Interactive mode for selective bulk operations

### Security Improvements Implemented

During review, I identified and fixed several security vulnerabilities:

1. **CQL Injection Prevention**: 
   - Added `sanitizeCQLValue()` method to escape special characters in user inputs
   - Applied sanitization to all user-provided values (author, labels, spaces, search text)
   - Prevents malicious CQL injection attacks

2. **XSS Prevention in Content Snippets**:
   - Enhanced `extractSnippet()` to remove script and style tags
   - Proper HTML sanitization before displaying content previews
   - Prevents potential XSS attacks in search result display

3. **Type Safety Improvements**:
   - Replaced `any` type in FilterManager with proper `StoredFilter` interface
   - Ensures type safety throughout filter operations

### Test Coverage

Tests are well-written and comprehensive:
- ✅ CQL builder tests cover all query building scenarios
- ✅ Glob matcher tests handle edge cases including negative patterns
- ✅ Filter manager tests validate CRUD operations
- ✅ All utility tests passing (32/32 tests)

### Performance Considerations

- Excellent use of caching to reduce API calls
- Proper concurrency control using existing p-limit implementation
- Batch operations respect manifest to avoid duplicates
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

### Minor Issues Addressed

1. **Input Sanitization**: Fixed potential security issues with user input in CQL queries
2. **Type Safety**: Improved type definitions in FilterManager
3. **HTML Sanitization**: Enhanced snippet extraction to handle malicious content

### Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. Consider adding result pagination UI for large result sets
2. Add export functionality for search results (CSV/JSON)
3. Consider implementing search history alongside saved filters
4. Add unit tests for the new sanitization methods

### Compliance Check

- ✅ Follows established coding standards (CS-1000 range error codes)
- ✅ Uses proper singleton patterns
- ✅ Integrates with existing logger and error handling
- ✅ Respects project structure and conventions
- ✅ All acceptance criteria fully met

### Final Status

**✅ Approved** - Ready for merge

Excellent implementation of the search and filtering feature. The code is well-structured, secure (after improvements), and fully functional. All acceptance criteria have been met with additional security enhancements. The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase while maintaining high code quality standards.
