## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion:
- Successfully implemented SHA-256 content hashing for change detection
- ManifestManager uses singleton pattern - maintain this pattern for any new managers
- Tests must use spyOn() instead of vi.mock() due to Bun runtime limitations
- All file paths must use path.resolve() for absolute paths
- Error codes follow CS-XXX pattern for consistent error handling
[Source: Story 2.1 Dev Agent Record]

### Existing Converter Infrastructure
The project already has two converter implementations:
- `src/converters/confluence-to-markdown.ts` - Converts Confluence storage format (XHTML) to Markdown using unified/rehype/remark pipeline
- `src/converters/markdown-to-confluence.ts` - Converts Markdown to Confluence storage format using remark parsing and AST transformation
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#converters]

### Libraries and Dependencies
**Primary conversion libraries already in project:**
- **unified/remark** (v15.0.0) - Extensible, reliable MD↔HTML conversion
- **rehype-parse** (v9.0.1) - HTML parsing for unified pipeline
- **rehype-remark** (v10.0.1) - HTML to Markdown conversion
- **remark-stringify** (v11.0.0) - Markdown serialization
- **remark-gfm** (v4.0.1) - GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- **remark-parse** (v11.0.0) - Markdown parsing
- **unist-util-visit** (v5.0.0) - AST traversal utilities
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### Current Implementation Details
**Confluence to Markdown Converter (`src/converters/confluence-to-markdown.ts`):**
- Already handles Confluence-specific elements (code macros, links, emoticons, layout sections)
- Has pre-processing for Confluence XHTML elements
- Has post-processing for Markdown cleanup (blank lines, headers, lists)
- Uses CS-500 error codes for error handling
- Has comprehensive test coverage (267 lines of tests in `tests/unit/converters/confluence-to-markdown.test.ts`)

**Markdown to Confluence Converter (`src/converters/markdown-to-confluence.ts`):**
- AST-based conversion using remark parser
- Supports GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
- Handles standard elements: headers, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables
- Outputs Confluence-specific elements (code macros, image attachments)
- Has HTML escaping for security
- **Missing comprehensive tests** - needs test file creation

### File Structure and Naming
Converter files location:
```
src/converters/
├── markdown-to-confluence.ts     # Existing - needs enhancement
├── confluence-to-markdown.ts     # Existing - needs enhancement
├── converter-registry.ts         # Not yet implemented - future work
└── utils.ts                      # Not yet implemented - create if needed for shared utilities
```
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#converters]

### Data Models
No specific converter data models defined, but converters interact with:
- **SyncConfig FormatOptions** - User preferences for conversion
- **ChangeSet** - Tracks conversion operations with direction: 'local-to-remote' | 'remote-to-local'
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#SyncConfig and ChangeSet]

### Coding Standards
**Critical conversion rules:**
- **"Format conversion must preserve data"** - Never lose content during MD↔HTML conversion
- Use logger utility from `src/utils/logger.ts` (never console.log)
- All error messages must include CS-XXX error codes (use CS-5XX range for converter errors)
- Use absolute file paths with path.resolve()
- Validate with zod schemas when applicable
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Code Patterns]

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use the existing unified/remark/rehype pipeline for conversions - don't introduce new libraries
- Both converters already exist and work - this story enhances them for better fidelity
- Focus on improving edge case handling and adding missing conversions
- Maintain the existing AST-based approach for reliable transformations
- Error codes should continue using CS-500 range for converter errors

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `tests/unit/converters/` mirroring src structure
- Use Vitest 1.2.0 framework with Bun test runner
- Coverage requirement: 80% for converters/ modules
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies where needed
- Use spyOn() for mocking (not vi.mock() due to Bun limitations)
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

### Existing Test Files
- `tests/unit/converters/confluence-to-markdown.test.ts` - 267 lines, comprehensive
- `tests/unit/converters/markdown-to-confluence.test.ts` - Needs to be created

### Test Requirements for This Story
- Create/enhance test files for both converters
- Add 20+ test cases total covering:
  - Table conversions with various structures
  - Nested lists (ordered, unordered, mixed)
  - Image references with different path types
  - Code blocks with various language hints
  - All Confluence panel types (info, warning, note, tip)
  - Internal and external links
  - Edge cases: malformed HTML, special characters, deeply nested structures
- Test round-trip conversion to ensure no data loss

## Senior Developer Review - Quinn (QA Architect)
**Review Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Review Type:** Code Quality & Architecture Assessment

### 🏆 Overall Assessment: APPROVED WITH EXCELLENCE

#### Code Quality Score: 9.5/10

### Architectural Alignment ✅
- **Unified/Remark Pipeline:** Excellent use of established pipeline, avoiding unnecessary dependencies
- **AST-based Approach:** Maintains reliability through proper AST traversal
- **Error Handling:** Proper CS-500 error codes implemented consistently
- **Singleton Pattern:** Properly maintained from Story 2.1
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clean separation between preprocessing, conversion, and postprocessing

### Code Excellence Highlights 🌟

#### 1. **Panel Conversion Strategy**
The placeholder approach (`__PANEL_${index}__`) is elegant and robust:
```typescript
// Excellent pattern for preserving complex elements through conversion
private panels: { id: string; type: string; content: string }[] = [];
```
This avoids loss during HTML→MD conversion - well architected!

#### 2. **Table Alignment Algorithm**
The column width calculation and padding implementation shows senior-level thinking:
```typescript
const currentWidth = colWidths[index] ?? 0; // Proper null coalescing
colWidths[index] = Math.max(currentWidth, cleanCell.length);
```
Good defensive programming with TypeScript strict mode compliance.

#### 3. **Robust Edge Case Handling**
- Empty cell detection
- Separator row identification
- Mixed list type support
- Malformed HTML graceful degradation

### Testing Excellence 📊
- **66 tests** exceeding the 20+ requirement by 230%
- **AAA pattern** properly followed
- **Edge cases** thoroughly covered
- **Round-trip testing** ensures data fidelity

### Minor Issues Found (Non-blocking) ⚠️

1. **Linting Issue** at `confluence-to-markdown.ts:239`
   - Missing newline after if statement
   - Run `bun run lint:fix` to resolve

2. **Type Safety Enhancement Opportunity**
   - Consider creating proper types for panel configurations instead of inline objects
   - Would improve maintainability

3. **Performance Consideration**
   - Table alignment runs on every conversion
   - Consider caching aligned tables for identical content

### Security & Best Practices ✅
- **HTML Escaping:** Properly implemented in `escapeHtml()`
- **CDATA Sections:** Correctly used for Confluence content
- **No Console Logs:** Uses logger utility as required
- **Absolute Paths:** Proper path resolution maintained

### Mentorship Notes 📚

1. **Preprocessing Pattern** - Transform incompatible formats before main conversion
2. **Placeholder Technique** - Preserve complex elements through transformations
3. **Defensive Programming** - Handle undefined array indices with null coalescing
4. **Test Coverage** - Go beyond minimum requirements for critical features

### Risk Assessment 🎯
- **Low Risk:** Implementation is solid with comprehensive testing
- **Data Integrity:** Round-trip testing confirms no data loss
- **Performance:** Suitable for expected document sizes
- **Maintainability:** Clean code structure enables future enhancements

### Recommendations for Future Improvements 🔮
1. **Performance Monitoring** - Add metrics for large document conversions
2. **Streaming Support** - Consider for very large documents (>10MB)
3. **Custom Panel Types** - Extensibility for organization-specific panels
4. **Conversion Profiles** - User-configurable conversion preferences

### Final Verdict ✅
**APPROVED** - This implementation demonstrates senior-level craftsmanship with excellent architectural decisions, comprehensive testing, and robust error handling. The code is production-ready with minor non-blocking improvements suggested.
