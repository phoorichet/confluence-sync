# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & CLI Bootstrap

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly configured TypeScript/Bun project with CLI entry point,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the sync tool.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. TypeScript project initialized with Bun runtime configuration and strict mode enabled
2. CLI framework (Commander.js) integrated with basic `confluence-sync` command that displays version and help
3. Build system configured using zshy to output both CJS and ESM modules to dist/
4. ESLint configured with project standards (2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons)
5. Vitest testing framework set up with sample test passing
6. Package.json configured for npm publishing with proper metadata and bin entry
7. Basic project structure created (src/commands, src/api, src/sync, src/utils)
8. Health check command implemented showing "Confluence Sync v{version} - OK"

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Technology Stack Table]

Key technologies for this story:
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.1.0 - JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3.3 - Primary development language with strict mode
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js 12.0.0 - Command-line interface parsing
- **Build Tool**: zshy 1.0.0 - TypeScript compilation, bundler-free, outputs CJS/ESM
- **Test Framework**: Vitest 1.2.0 - Unit and integration testing, Bun-compatible
- **Linter/Formatter**: ESLint 8.56.0 with @nyxb/eslint-config

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards]

- TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode enabled
- ESLint with @nyxb/eslint-config
- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required

### File Locations
Based on project structure, new files should be created in:
- `src/cli.ts` - Main CLI entry point
- `src/commands/index.ts` - Command registry
- `src/commands/health.ts` - Health check command
- `src/api/index.ts` - API module placeholder
- `src/sync/index.ts` - Sync module placeholder
- `src/utils/index.ts` - Utils module placeholder
- `tests/commands/health.test.ts` - Health command test

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Bun runtime (not Node.js)
- TypeScript must be in strict mode
- Build output must support both CommonJS and ES modules
- CLI binary name should be `confluence-sync`

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack - Test Framework]

- Use Vitest 1.2.0 for all testing
- Test files should be placed in `tests/` directory mirroring src/ structure
- Tests should follow pattern: `{filename}.test.ts`
- Focus on unit tests for this story
- Ensure tests are Bun-compatible

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of the project foundation. The TypeScript configuration is properly set up with strict mode, the CLI framework is well-integrated with Commander.js, and the build system is correctly configured with zshy producing both CJS and ESM outputs. All acceptance criteria have been met with high-quality code.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/utils/package-info.ts (new)
  - **Change**: Created a centralized utility module for package.json operations
  - **Why**: Both cli.ts and health.ts were duplicating code to read package.json
  - **How**: Extracted common logic into reusable functions with caching, improving maintainability and performance

- **File**: src/cli.ts
  - **Change**: Refactored to use the new package-info utility
  - **Why**: Eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability
  - **How**: Replaced inline package.json reading with utility function calls, making the code cleaner and more focused

- **File**: src/commands/health.ts  
  - **Change**: Simplified to use package-info utility
  - **Why**: Remove duplicate file reading logic and improve code organization
  - **How**: Replaced manual package.json path resolution and reading with a simple utility function call

- **File**: src/utils/index.ts
  - **Change**: Updated to export the new package-info utilities
  - **Why**: Make utilities accessible through the module's public API
  - **How**: Added export statement for package-info module

- **File**: tests/unit/utils/package-info.test.ts (new)
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive unit tests for the new utility module
  - **Why**: Ensure the refactored code works correctly and maintains coverage
  - **How**: Created tests covering all utility functions and caching behavior

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows ESLint configuration with 2-space indent, single quotes, and semicolons
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfectly aligned with architecture document structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Vitest configured correctly with comprehensive unit tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Eliminated code duplication between cli.ts and health.ts
- [x] Created reusable package-info utility with caching
- [x] Added comprehensive tests for new utility module
- [x] Fixed all linting issues to maintain code standards
- [x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring
- [x] Ensured build system continues to work correctly

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly uses Node.js APIs and doesn't expose sensitive information.

### Performance Considerations

Improved performance by implementing caching in the package-info utility, preventing repeated file system reads of package.json during runtime.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

All acceptance criteria met with excellent code quality. The refactoring improvements enhance maintainability without changing functionality. All tests pass, linting is clean, and the build system works perfectly.
