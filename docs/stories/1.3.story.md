# Story 1.3: OpenAPI Client Generation & Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** auto-generated TypeScript types from Confluence OpenAPI spec,
**so that** I have type-safe API interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Script to download latest Confluence OpenAPI specification implemented
2. OpenAPI TypeScript generation configured to output to src/types/confluence.ts
3. openapi-fetch client initialized with authentication headers
4. Type-safe wrapper functions created for core API operations (getPage, updatePage)
5. Error handling middleware added for API responses
6. Rate limiting compliance built into client (respecting 5000 req/hour)
7. Generated types successfully compile with strict TypeScript settings

  - [x] Implement exponential backoff with jitter (max 3 retries) for transient failures
  - [x] Set timeout configurations: 30s for single page, 5min for bulk operations
  - [x] Create custom error classes extending base Error with CS-XXX codes

  - [x] Test rate limiting behavior under high request load
  - [x] Verify generated types compile and provide proper type safety

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- AuthManager implemented in src/auth/auth-manager.ts with methods: authenticate(), getToken(), clearCredentials(), validateAuth()
- Authentication supports both Cloud (Basic Auth with email:api_token) and Server (Bearer token with PAT)
- Credentials stored securely using @zowe/secrets-for-zowe-sdk
- API client needs to be updated to use AuthManager for credentials
- Error codes (CS-XXX) pattern established for consistent error handling
- Logger utility created in src/utils/logger.ts with sanitization to prevent secrets in logs

### Project Structure
Based on architecture, API-related files should be created in:
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
```
src/
├── api/
│   ├── client.ts           # openapi-fetch client setup
│   ├── types.ts            # Auto-generated Confluence types
│   ├── rate-limiter.ts     # Rate limiting logic
│   └── circuit-breaker.ts  # Circuit breaker implementation
├── openapi/
│   └── confluence-openapi.json  # Downloaded OpenAPI spec
└── scripts/
    ├── download-openapi.ts  # Download Confluence OpenAPI script
    └── generate-types.ts    # Generate TypeScript from OpenAPI
```

### Libraries and Dependencies
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- **openapi-fetch 0.9.0**: Type-safe Confluence API calls with auto-generated types
- **openapi-typescript 6.7.0**: Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI specification
- **p-limit 5.0.0**: Concurrent operation control for rate limiting and preventing API overload
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: For integration testing with mock Confluence API

### API Client Requirements
[Source: architecture/components.md#API Client]
The API Client component must:
- Handle all Confluence API interactions with type safety, rate limiting, and error handling
- Implement key interfaces: getPage(), updatePage(), getSpace(), searchPages()
- Use openapi-fetch with auto-generated types
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience

### Confluence API Details
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Confluence REST API]
- **Cloud instances** (*.atlassian.net):
  - Base URL: `https://{domain}.atlassian.net/wiki/api/v2`
  - Rate limit: 5000 requests per hour per user
  - Authentication: OAuth 2.0 or API Token with Basic Auth
- **Server instances** (custom domains):
  - Base URL: `https://{server}/rest/api`
  - No hard rate limit (instance-dependent)
  - Authentication: Personal Access Token or Basic Auth
- **Important considerations**:
  - Handle both storage format (XHTML) and view format (HTML)
  - Version number must be incremented on updates to prevent conflicts
  - Use `expand` parameter to reduce API calls
  - Cache frequently accessed metadata to minimize API calls

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#External API Errors]
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#General Approach]
- **Circuit Breaker**: Open after 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30s
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with jitter, max 3 retries
- **Timeouts**: 30s for single page, 5min for bulk operations
- **Error Codes**: Use CS-XXX pattern for all errors
- Map HTTP status codes to user-friendly messages
- Never expose sensitive data in error messages

### Critical Implementation Rules
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]
- Always use apiClient for API calls - never use fetch directly
- All API responses must use type guards - never cast API responses directly, validate with zod schemas
- Every API call must go through the rate-limited client
- Every error must have a CS-XXX error code
- No secrets in logs or error messages

### Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test Framework**: Vitest 1.2.0

**Unit Tests**:
- Location: `tests/unit/api/` mirroring `src/api/` structure
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test file naming: `{module}.test.ts`
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions

**Integration Tests**:
- Location: `tests/integration/api/`
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking Confluence API
- Test complete API workflows including authentication
- Verify rate limiting and error handling behaviors

**Required Test Coverage**:
- All wrapper functions with various input scenarios
- Rate limiting behavior under load
- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Error handling for all HTTP status codes
- Authentication header injection
- Type safety verification

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Strong implementation with excellent separation of concerns and resilience patterns. The API client successfully implements all required features including circuit breaker, rate limiting, and error handling. The code follows best practices with comprehensive test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/api/client.ts
  - **Change**: Implemented singleton pattern with proper initialization tracking
  - **Why**: Prevents multiple instances and double initialization issues
  - **How**: Added static getInstance() method and initialization flag, ensuring single instance across the application

- **File**: src/api/client.ts
  - **Change**: Added TypeScript interfaces for PageResponse and SpaceResponse
  - **Why**: Improved type safety by replacing `any` types
  - **How**: Defined proper interfaces matching API response structure, providing compile-time type checking

- **File**: src/api/client.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed searchPages to properly use the query parameter
  - **Why**: The query parameter was unused (prefixed with _)
  - **How**: Implemented proper query parameter handling for V2 API title filtering

- **File**: src/api/client.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed numeric ID type issues for DELETE and children endpoints
  - **Why**: OpenAPI spec requires numeric IDs for certain endpoints
  - **How**: Added proper string-to-number conversion with validation

- **File**: src/api/client.ts
  - **Change**: Removed getPageContent method, replaced with parameter in getPage
  - **Why**: V2 API doesn't have separate body endpoint, uses query parameters
  - **How**: Modified getPage to accept includeBody parameter with proper body-format query

- **File**: tests/unit/api/client.test.ts
  - **Change**: Updated test to reflect API changes
  - **Why**: Test was checking for removed getPageContent method
  - **How**: Removed obsolete test, added comment about using getPage with parameter
