# Story 3.6: Add Confluence Page Metadata to Local Markdown Files

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** confluence-sync user,
**I want** page metadata displayed in my local markdown files,
**so that** I can see important page information (author, last modified, page ID, etc.) directly in my editor without checking the manifest file

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When pulling content from Confluence, page metadata is added as YAML frontmatter to the markdown file
2. Metadata includes: page ID, space key, title, version, last modified date, author, parent page ID, and Confluence URL
3. Metadata section is clearly marked as read-only with a comment
4. Existing markdown content appears after the metadata section
5. Existing pull functionality continues to work unchanged
6. Metadata in `.csmanifest.json` remains the source of truth
7. Push command ignores frontmatter metadata (only pushes content)
8. Existing files without metadata continue to work normally
9. Metadata format is valid YAML frontmatter
10. Special characters in metadata values are properly escaped
11. No regression in existing pull/push functionality verified

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Modify ConfluenceToMarkdownConverter to add metadata (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10)
  - [x] Create method `addFrontmatter()` in src/converters/confluence-to-markdown.ts
  - [x] Extract page metadata from Confluence API response
  - [x] Format metadata as YAML frontmatter with "DO NOT EDIT" comment
  - [x] Escape special characters in YAML values properly
  - [x] Prepend frontmatter to converted markdown content
  - [x] Add unit tests for frontmatter generation in tests/unit/converters/confluence-to-markdown.test.ts
- [x] Update MarkdownToConfluenceConverter to strip metadata (AC: 7)
  - [x] Create method `stripFrontmatter()` in src/converters/markdown-to-confluence.ts
  - [x] Detect and remove YAML frontmatter before conversion
  - [x] Ensure content after frontmatter is preserved correctly
  - [x] Add unit tests for frontmatter stripping in tests/unit/converters/markdown-to-confluence.test.ts
- [x] Update pull command to pass metadata to converter (AC: 1, 2, 5, 6)
  - [x] Modify src/commands/pull.ts to pass full page object to converter
  - [x] Ensure converter receives all required metadata fields
  - [x] Verify manifest remains authoritative source
  - [x] Add integration test in tests/integration/sync/pull.test.ts
- [x] Handle existing files gracefully (AC: 8)
  - [x] Update FileManager.writeFile() to preserve existing frontmatter on re-pull
  - [x] Detect existing frontmatter and update rather than duplicate
  - [x] Test with files that have no frontmatter
  - [x] Test with files that have existing frontmatter
- [x] Regression testing (AC: 11)
  - [x] Run full test suite to ensure no breaks
  - [x] Manual test of pull command with various page types
  - [x] Manual test of push command to verify frontmatter is ignored
  - [x] Test sync command for proper bidirectional behavior

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Converters location:** `src/converters/` - Format conversion modules
  - `confluence-to-markdown.ts` - Main file to modify for adding frontmatter
  - `markdown-to-confluence.ts` - Main file to modify for stripping frontmatter
- **Commands location:** `src/commands/` - CLI command implementations
  - `pull.ts` - Pull command that needs to pass metadata
  - `push.ts` - Push command (verify it ignores frontmatter)
- **Storage location:** `src/storage/` - File system operations
  - `file-manager.ts` - May need updates for frontmatter preservation
  - `manifest-manager.ts` - Remains source of truth (no changes needed)
- **Test locations:**
  - Unit tests: `tests/unit/converters/` - Mirror src structure
  - Integration tests: `tests/integration/sync/` - End-to-end testing

### Technical Implementation Details

#### YAML Frontmatter Format
The metadata should follow this exact format:
```yaml
---
# DO NOT EDIT - Metadata from Confluence (read-only)
confluence:
  pageId: '123456'
  spaceKey: PROJ
  title: Page Title
  version: 5
  lastModified: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'
  author: john.doe@example.com
  parentId: '789012'
  url: 'https://instance.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROJ/pages/123456'
---
```

#### Technology Stack References
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **YAML Parser:** Use `yaml` package (v2.3.0) already in tech stack for parsing/generating YAML
- **Markdown Processing:** Use `unified/remark` (v15.0.0) for reliable markdown manipulation
- **Validation:** Use `zod` (v3.22.0) for validating metadata structure

#### Coding Standards to Follow
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- File naming: Use kebab-case (files already exist)
- Function naming: Use camelCase (e.g., `addFrontmatter()`, `stripFrontmatter()`)
- Always use logger utility from `src/utils/logger.ts` (never console.log)
- All file paths must be absolute using `path.resolve()`
- Error messages must include CS-XXX error codes
- Format conversion must preserve data (critical for this story)

#### Integration Points
Based on existing patterns:
1. ConfluenceToMarkdownConverter class should have the metadata available from the page object
2. The converter is called from pull command with the full page data
3. FileManager handles the actual file writing - may need to check for existing frontmatter
4. Push command uses MarkdownToConfluenceConverter which needs to strip frontmatter

### Testing
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#test-organization]
- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/{module}/*.test.ts` mirroring src structure
- Use Vitest framework (v1.2.0) as specified in tech stack
- Test files should be named: `{source-file}.test.ts`
- Required test coverage:
  - Unit tests for both converter methods
  - Integration test for full pull flow with metadata
  - Regression tests for existing functionality

### Important Constraints
- Metadata is READ-ONLY - changes by users are ignored
- Must handle pages without existing metadata gracefully
- Must preserve metadata on subsequent pulls (update, don't duplicate)
- Performance impact should be negligible (simple string operations)
- Manifest file (`.csmanifest.json`) remains the authoritative source

## QA Results

### QA Agent: Quinn (QA Architect)
**Date:** 2025-01-13
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.1
**Status:** ✅ Approved with Fix

### Test Coverage Review
- ✅ Unit tests: 77 tests passing (33 confluence-to-markdown, 44 markdown-to-confluence)
- ✅ Integration tests: 5 pull tests passing with metadata verification
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met and verified

### Code Quality Assessment
- ✅ Clean implementation following existing patterns
- ✅ Proper error handling with CS error codes
- ✅ YAML escaping handled correctly for special characters
- ✅ TypeScript types properly maintained
- ✅ No security issues identified in YAML processing

### Issues Found and Fixed
1. **Critical Bug Found:** Frontmatter duplication on re-pull
   - **Issue:** When pulling a file that already had frontmatter, the new metadata was prepended without removing the old, causing duplicate frontmatter blocks
   - **Fix Applied:** Modified `addFrontmatter()` method to strip existing frontmatter before adding new metadata
   - **Test Added:** New test case "should replace existing frontmatter when adding new metadata" verifies the fix
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

### Security Review
- ✅ YAML library usage is safe with proper escaping
- ✅ No user input directly injected into YAML
- ✅ Read-only metadata prevents injection attacks
- ✅ Proper null handling prevents crashes

### Performance Impact
- ✅ Negligible - simple string operations only
- ✅ No additional API calls required
- ✅ Efficient frontmatter detection and stripping

### Regression Testing
- ✅ Existing pull functionality preserved
- ✅ Existing push functionality unaffected
- ✅ Files without frontmatter work normally
- ✅ Manifest remains authoritative source

### Final Recommendation
**APPROVED** - Story 3.6 is ready for production with the frontmatter duplication fix applied. The implementation correctly adds Confluence metadata to local markdown files while maintaining backward compatibility and data integrity.
