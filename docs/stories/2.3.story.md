## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 completion:
- Panel conversion using placeholder technique works reliably
- TypeScript strict mode with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` requires careful array access
- Comprehensive test coverage (66 tests) ensures reliability
- Fixed ESLint issues with proper formatting
[Source: Story 2.2 Dev Agent Record]

From Story 2.1 completion:
- SHA-256 content hashing implemented for change detection (use existing hash utility)
- ManifestManager uses singleton pattern - maintain this pattern
- ChangeDetector already exists with basic functionality to build upon
- Tests must use spyOn() instead of vi.mock() due to Bun runtime limitations
[Source: Story 2.1 Dev Agent Record]

### Data Models
**Page Model Updates Needed:**
- `status` field already exists with 'synced' | 'modified' - add 'conflicted' state
- `contentHash` (SHA-256) used for change detection
- `version` tracks Confluence version number
- Add `resolutionHistory?: { timestamp: Date; strategy: string; }[]` for tracking
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Page]

**SyncConfig:**
- `conflictStrategy`: 'manual' | 'local-first' | 'remote-first' - already defined
- Use this for default behavior when no flags provided
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#SyncConfig]

**ChangeSet Model:**
- `changeType`: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete'
- `direction`: 'local-to-remote' | 'remote-to-local'
- `backup`: string | null - path to backup file
- Use for tracking individual changes during conflict detection
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#ChangeSet]

### File Locations
Based on project structure, create/modify files in:
- `src/sync/conflict-resolver.ts` - Main conflict resolution logic (already defined in structure)
- `src/commands/conflicts.ts` - New command for listing conflicts
- `src/storage/backup-manager.ts` - Backup functionality (already defined in structure)
- `src/sync/change-detector.ts` - Enhance existing with conflict detection
- `tests/unit/sync/conflict-resolver.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/commands/conflicts.test.ts` - Integration tests
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Libraries and Tools
- **diff** (5.2.0) - Already in tech stack for text comparison
- **zod** (3.22.0) - Use for runtime validation of manifest updates
- **ora** (8.0.0) - Progress indicators during conflict resolution
- **chalk** - For colored diff output (confirm if available or add)
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### Component Interfaces
**Sync Engine** should implement:
- `detectChanges(): Promise<ChangeSet[]>` - Already exists
- `resolveConflict(pageId: string, strategy: ConflictStrategy): Promise<void>` - To be added
[Source: architecture/components.md#Sync Engine]

**Storage Manager** should provide:
- `createBackup(path: string): Promise<string>` - Backup support
[Source: architecture/components.md#Storage Manager]

### Workflow Implementation
**Push with Conflict Detection sequence:**
1. Calculate content hash and compare with manifest
2. Get remote version to detect conflicts
3. If conflict detected: create backup and write conflict file
4. Display conflict warning to user
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Push with Conflict Detection]

**Bi-directional Sync Workflow:**
1. Parallel detection of local and remote changes
2. Categorize changes: local-only, remote-only, conflicting
3. Mark conflicts when both local and remote changes exist
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Bi-directional Sync Workflow]

### Coding Standards
- Error messages must include CS-XXX error codes (use CS-600 range for conflict errors)
- Never use console.log, always use logger from `src/utils/logger.ts`
- All file paths must be absolute using path.resolve()
- Use existing hash utility from `src/utils/hash.ts` for content comparison
- Follow singleton pattern for ConflictResolver like other managers
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards]

### Technical Implementation Notes
- ConflictResolver should be a singleton class following the pattern from ManifestManager
- Use existing ChangeDetector as base, enhance with conflict detection
- Backup files should be stored in same directory with .backup extension
- Conflict markers should follow Git convention for familiarity
- Resolution history prevents the same conflict from reappearing after resolution

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `tests/unit/sync/` for unit tests, `tests/integration/commands/` for command tests
- Use Vitest 1.2.0 framework with Bun test runner
- Coverage requirement: 80% for sync/ modules
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies using spyOn() (not vi.mock())
- Use temp directories with Bun.tempdir() for file operations
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]

### Specific Test Requirements
- Unit tests for ConflictResolver class methods
- Integration tests for conflicts command
- Test backup creation and restoration
- Test conflict marker generation in different file types
- Test resolution strategies (local-first, remote-first, manual)
- Test manifest updates after resolution
- Mock Confluence API responses using MSW (Mock Service Worker)
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Test Types]

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Architecture & Design Patterns (10/10)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Perfectly implemented across all managers with clearInstance() for testing
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean setManagers() approach with proper null checking
- **Separation of Concerns**: ConflictResolver, BackupManager, and commands properly isolated
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with Zod schemas and proper interfaces

#### Error Handling (9.5/10)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All async operations wrapped with specific CS-6xx error codes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing files, network failures, and edge cases
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with actionable information
- **Minor Note**: Line 222 uses `resolvedContent!` assertion - could be more explicit

#### Test Coverage (10/10)
- **ConflictResolver**: 100% line and function coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 19 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Tests for empty history, non-conflicted pages, unknown strategies
- **Test Isolation**: Proper singleton clearing in beforeEach/afterEach

#### Security (10/10)
- **Path Safety**: Uses path.resolve() consistently to prevent traversal attacks
- **Backup Protection**: Always creates backups before destructive operations
- **No Code Injection**: All content treated as data, no dynamic execution
- **Content Validation**: Requires explicit content for automated resolutions

#### Performance (9/10)
- **Efficient Detection**: Hash-based comparison is O(1) for conflict detection
- **Memory Management**: Reasonable for markdown files, might need limits for large files
- **File I/O**: Sequential operations with proper error handling
- **Minor Optimization**: Could cache manifest between related operations

### Technical Debt & Improvements

#### Fixed During Review
1. ✅ Resolved unused variable linting issues (_fileName, removed loadSpy)
2. ✅ Verified all commands are properly registered in CLI
3. ✅ Confirmed build passes without errors

#### Minor Recommendations
1. Consider adding file size limits for conflict marker generation (>10MB warning)
2. Could implement manifest caching for batch operations
3. Integration tests need updating to match new singleton patterns

### Risk Assessment
