# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable developers and technical writers to edit Confluence content using their preferred local text editors and AI assistants
- Provide seamless bi-directional synchronization between Confluence and local filesystem
- Reduce documentation creation time by 40% through local tooling and AI integration
- Maintain Confluence as the single source of truth while enabling flexible local workflows
- Support bulk operations and Git-based version control for documentation
- Achieve 100+ active users within 6 months with 80% retention rate

## Background Context

Confluence Sync addresses the significant friction technical teams face when working with Confluence's web-based editor. Currently, teams must choose between Confluence's collaboration features and the advanced capabilities of modern development environments. This tool bridges that gap by treating Confluence pages as local files, enabling developers to leverage AI assistants (Copilot, Claude), advanced editing features, and familiar Git workflows while maintaining Confluence as the central documentation platform. The solution is particularly critical as teams report 30-50% slower content creation in web editors compared to local IDEs, and the absence of AI assistance means missing productivity gains that can accelerate writing by 2-3x.
