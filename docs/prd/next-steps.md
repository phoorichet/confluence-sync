# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

N/A - This is a CLI tool without traditional UI requirements. UX considerations have been incorporated into the CLI command structure and user feedback mechanisms within the functional requirements.

## Architect Prompt

Please create the technical architecture for the Confluence Sync CLI tool based on the attached PRD. Focus on designing a modular, extensible system using Bun/TypeScript with openapi-fetch for API interactions. Key areas requiring architectural decisions include: concurrent operation strategies, caching layer design, conflict detection algorithms, and plugin architecture for future extensibility. Ensure the design supports the 3-epic MVP delivery within a 3-month timeline with part-time development resources.
