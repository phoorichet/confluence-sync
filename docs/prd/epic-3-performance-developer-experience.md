# Epic 3: Performance & Developer Experience

Optimize the tool for real-world usage with large documentation sets, enhance CLI usability with better commands and feedback, and add power-user features that multiply productivity. This transforms the tool from functional to delightful.

## Story 3.1: Concurrent Operations & Performance

As a power user,
I want fast operations even with many pages,
so that the tool remains responsive at scale.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Concurrent API calls for multi-page operations (configurable parallelism)
2: Connection pooling for HTTP requests with keep-alive
3: Local caching layer to avoid redundant API calls
4: Batch API operations where Confluence supports them
5: Memory-efficient streaming for large pages (>1MB)
6: Performance metrics displayed with --verbose flag
7: Operations on 50 pages complete in under 10 seconds

## Story 3.2: Enhanced CLI Experience

As a user,
I want intuitive commands and helpful feedback,
so that using the tool feels natural and efficient.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Interactive mode for auth and conflict resolution (using prompts)
2: Colored output for better readability (success=green, error=red, warning=yellow)
3: Progress bars with ETA for long operations
4: `confluence-sync init` wizard for initial setup
5: Shell completion scripts for bash/zsh/fish
6: Helpful error messages with suggested fixes
7: `--json` flag for machine-readable output

## Story 3.3: Watch Mode & Continuous Sync

As a developer,
I want automatic synchronization as I work,
so that changes flow seamlessly between local and remote.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: `confluence-sync watch` monitors file changes and syncs automatically
2: Debouncing to avoid excessive API calls during rapid edits
3: File system watcher using native OS capabilities for efficiency
4: Configurable ignore patterns (.syncignore file support)
5: Status indicator showing watch mode active and last sync time
6: Graceful handling of network interruptions with retry logic
7: Notification (desktop or terminal) when sync completes or fails

## Story 3.4: Configuration & Profiles

As a user working with multiple Confluence instances,
I want configuration profiles and settings,
so that I can easily switch contexts.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: `.confluence-sync.yml` configuration file with all settings
2: Multiple named profiles for different Confluence instances
3: Profile switching with `confluence-sync use <profile>`
4: Environment variable support for CI/CD scenarios
5: Global and project-specific configuration with proper precedence
6: Configuration validation with helpful error messages
7: `confluence-sync config` command to view/edit settings

## Story 3.5: Advanced Search & Filtering

As a user,
I want to find and sync specific content efficiently,
so that I can work with subsets of documentation.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: `confluence-sync search <query>` finds pages by title or content
2: Filter flags: --author, --modified-after, --label, --space
3: Glob pattern support for selective sync operations
4: CQL (Confluence Query Language) support for power users
5: Search results with preview snippets
6: Bulk operations on search results (pull all matching)
7: Save search queries as named filters for reuse
