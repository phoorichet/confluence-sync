## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None identified

**HIGH:**
- None

**MEDIUM:**
- Data migration strategy for manifest schema evolution could be more detailed
- Operational monitoring and alerting specifics need definition
- Integration testing approach for Confluence API could be expanded

**LOW:**
- Could add more specific performance benchmarks for concurrent operations
- Documentation requirements for end-users could be specified

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Appropriateness:** The MVP scope is well-balanced and achievable:
- Core functionality (auth, pull, push, sync) delivers immediate value
- Advanced features properly deferred to post-MVP
- 3-month timeline realistic with part-time development
- Clear progression from basic to advanced functionality

**Features Correctly Excluded from MVP:**
- GUI/web interface
- Advanced Confluence macros
- Attachment synchronization
- Automated conflict resolution
- Real-time collaboration

**Essential Features Included:**
- Authentication with secure storage
- Basic pull/push operations
- Format conversion (Markdown ↔ Confluence)
- Conflict detection
- Manifest-based state tracking

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:** Excellent
- Runtime environment (Bun) clearly specified
- TypeScript with strict mode defined
- Build system (zshy) documented
- API client approach (openapi-fetch) established

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- Confluence API rate limiting at scale
- Format conversion fidelity for complex content
- Conflict resolution complexity
- Performance with large spaces (1000+ pages)

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
- Optimal caching strategy for API responses
- Diff algorithm selection for conflict detection
- Concurrent operation limits and backpressure
- Plugin architecture design for extensibility

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:** None required - PRD is ready for architect

2. **Suggested Enhancements:**
   - Add specific metrics for monitoring (response times, sync failures, API usage)
   - Define data migration test scenarios for manifest evolution
   - Specify user documentation deliverables per epic

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Proceed with architect engagement using provided prompt
   - Consider creating technical spike stories for high-risk areas
   - Plan user research sessions to validate workflow assumptions

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT:** The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The requirements are clear, testable, and appropriately scoped for MVP delivery within the 3-month timeline.
